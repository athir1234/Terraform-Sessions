1. Create a storage account with the name azuretutorterraform28 and azuretutorterraform29

azuretutorterraform28 --> account needs to have 5 containers with own names
azuretutorterraform29 --> account needs to have 6 containers with own names

Pick the best-option to satisfy the above requirement.
Make sure it is reusable

2. Create a NSG with 5 security rules

Rules to be enabled --> 80 / 443 / 8080 / 22 / 8081

Make sure it is reusable

3. Create two tfvars files (dev.tfvars /uat.tfvars)

If it is dev environment I need to create the App service plan with F1 tier 
If it is uat environment I need to create the app service plan with B1 tier

Create the tags based on the environment.

Code must be reusable and implement conditional parameters

Once this created create an appservice for both dev and uat and apply lifecycle ignore changes for tags / app settings
